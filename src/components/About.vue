    As a programmer, I think a lot about user interaction, engagement, and
    multisensory experiences. What I love about coding is that the possibilities
    are endless at the intersection of ideas and imagination. I'm a huge
    believer in the power of ideas and collaborating with others using effective
    communication to bring concepts to fruition.
